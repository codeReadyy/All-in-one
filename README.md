# AllInOne

## Purpose
Angular application using version 8.3.5. It will contain only short applications as a component. Soon I will add side nav which will contain list of short application name with the ability of search and select. You are most welcome to add yours.

## Installation

Run `npm install` and then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` for each of your application.

## Future enhancement
- Test cases should be added for each function/feature/component
- Introduce Flex styling as common style
- ...
